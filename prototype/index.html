    	<h2>Part One: Your best brainstorming session</h2>
		<details open><summary>Introduction</summary>
		To begin with, let's revisit some past brainstorming sessions that you ever attended as a participant. Can you describe a session that worked out particularly well? Use the following questions to guide your reflection. 

        <div>1. What was the context and purpose of the session?</div>
        <div>2. How were you feeling in the session?</div>
        <div>3. What results did it achieve?</div>
        <div>4. What contributed to the successful results? try to think of as many details as you can, such as the room, the people, the facilitator, the process, the questions, the methods, ... </div>

	<h2>Part Two: Success factors of facilitating an effective brainstorming session</h2>
	<details open><summary>Introduction</summary>
		Now that you have reflected on some successful brainstorming experiences. Let's take a look at what factors contribute to their successes. In this part, you will learn six success factors with specific examples. As you go through them, think critically how they might work for your particular contexts and audience? While I find these factors useful for most successful sessions, facilitators usually adjust them to particular situations. Click into the following videos by sequence.
